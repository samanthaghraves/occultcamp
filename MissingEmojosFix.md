**A Fix for If your Emojos have their images deleted**

Given that this seems to be a more common occurance, and It's always good to have a single space for stuff like this, 
I just wanted to add this fix that I found, that theZacAttacks improved.

Simply install the Katalon Recorder into your browser (Tested on Firefox and Chrome) and then import the linked gist into
your Katalon, change the domain to your domain and bingo-bango let it run and delete all of your broken
emojos so that it can rebuild them!

*ITS SO SIMPLE*
